# App Setup and Configuration Guide 

Follow these steps to set up and configure the application to run it locally 📓

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following softwares installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 14 or higher) 🧘
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (version 1.22 or higher) 🎊

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository 🌀 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/azevedev/api-node-pilab
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the root directory and install the project dependencies using Yarn:

```shell
cd api-node-pilab
yarn install
```

This will download ⬇ and install all the required dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

#### Step 3: Build the Application

To build the TypeScript code into JavaScript, run the following command 👇 

```shell
yarn build
```

This will compile the TypeScript code and generate the JavaScript output in the designated directory (e.g., `dist` 👍)

#### Step 4: Migrations and Seeds 🌱

You'll need a database to use the application. I've added a seed file (☝🤓) that will populate your database to simplify the process.

In order to use the migrations, just type ⌨
```shell
yarn knex:migrate
```
This command will create the database and run the migrations. After that is done, just type:
```shell
yarn knex:seed
```

#### Step 5: Start the Application

Once the build process is complete and you created the database, you can start the application locally using the following command:

```shell
yarn start
```
This will run the compiled TypeScript code inside `dist` on your local machine using Node.

To use the TypeScript files on your server, meaning run it as a dev 💻, use:

```shell
yarn dev
```

And that's it! 👏🚀
You can test the application on `http://localhost:3333/api/v1`. Make sure it's the correct port (it'll be displayed on your console).

Feel free to explore and customize the code according to your requirements. Cheers! 👋
